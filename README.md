<b>About the Project:</b>

RubyGems needs a way to mark a gem as "maintainer needed" or "someone please take this gem over". This project would drive the creation of an "Adoption Center" (Possibly at http://adoption.rubygems.org) where people could list gems that want a maintainer/someone new to help fix issues, cut releases, etc, and then assist in the handoff of the gem.
